#  Databricks Cluster Migration, Unity Catalog Setup, Environment Variable Management, and Reversion

This repository contains a Python-based solution for managing Databricks clusters, enabling Unity Catalog, upgrading cluster runtimes, managing environment variables, and reverting clusters to their previous configurations based on a backup.

### Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure the following:

- Cluster Setup: You must run this notebook on a cluster with Unity Catalog (UC) enabled.
- Single User Access: The UC cluster does not support "No Isolation Shared" mode, so ensure that the cluster is in "Single User Access" mode.
- Python Environment: Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed in your environment.

Required Libraries
The script requires the pyyaml library to read configuration files and the requests library to interact with the Databricks API. To install them, run:

%pip install pyyaml requests

### Configuration
config.yaml
Before running the code, you need to create and configure a config.yaml file. It should contain the following details:

- DATABRICKS_INSTANCE: The URL of your Databricks instance.
- TOKEN: Your Databricks API token.
- new_runtime_version: The Databricks runtime version you want to upgrade to.
- cluster_ids: A list of Databricks cluster IDs that need to be upgraded.
- single_user_name: The email address of the single user for Unity Catalog access.

Make sure to replace placeholder values with your actual configuration details.

### Script Breakdown
1. Backup Cluster Details
The script allows you to backup the configuration of each cluster by fetching its current settings and saving them to a JSON file. This ensures that you can restore the cluster configuration if needed.

2. Upgrade Cluster Runtime & Enable Unity Catalog
The core function of the script upgrades the runtime version of each cluster to a version compatible with Unity Catalog. It ensures Unity Catalog is enabled and makes any necessary changes to the cluster's environment variables, configurations, and security settings.

3. Upgrade Multiple Clusters
The script supports upgrading multiple clusters by iterating through a list of cluster IDs, applying the same runtime version and Unity Catalog configuration to each one.

4. Revert Cluster to Previous State
The script also includes functionality to revert clusters to their previous configuration based on a backup file. It compares the current configuration of the cluster with the saved backup and restores the cluster settings accordingly. This is particularly useful if you need to undo any changes or restore clusters to a known stable configuration.

5. Manage Environment Variables
The script can also handle the management of environment variables, such as MY_VOLUME_PATH. It ensures that the necessary environment variables are set correctly, which can be used for reading data from specified volumes in the Databricks environment.

### Usage

1)Edit Configuration: Update the config.yaml file with your specific details, including the list of cluster IDs and the MY_VOLUME_PATH for the environment variable.

2)Run the Script: Execute the notebook or Python script to:
- Backup cluster details.
- Upgrade the runtime and enable Unity Catalog on multiple clusters.
- Revert clusters to their previous configurations.
- Manage and migrate environment variables.
- Read data from the volume path.

### Troubleshooting

- Cluster Not Found: If the script fails to fetch the cluster details, verify that the cluster_id in your configuration file is correct.
- Failed to Update Runtime: Check if the specified new_runtime_version is valid and compatible with Unity Catalog.
- Failed to Restart Cluster: Ensure the cluster is in a healthy state and is not already in the process of restarting.
- Data Reading Issue: Verify that the MY_VOLUME_PATH environment variable is correctly set and points to the correct location of your data.
